## About

**TitanBeatsBot** is not just a music bot — it's an experience. Every command you issue is like sending the Survey Corps out to battle. Every track is a new mission. The bot responds with themed dialogues, intense visuals, and UI that reflects the dark, cinematic atmosphere of **Attack on Titan**.

> “This world is merciless… and it’s also very musical.”  
> — *Mikasa Ackerman, probably*
